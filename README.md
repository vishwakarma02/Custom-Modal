# 🧩 Angular Standalone Modal Component

A reusable, dependency-free modal implementation in Angular using **standalone components**, `ngComponentOutlet`, and `InjectionToken` — without relying on Angular Material or `ElementRef`.

---

## ✅ Features

- ✔️ Dynamically render any component in a modal
- ✔️ Pass data via `InjectionToken`
- ✔️ `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for performance
- ✔️ Self-cleaning when closed
- ✔️ No `ElementRef`, `ViewChild`, or `@angular/material`
- ✔️ Works with Angular Signals & zoneless apps
